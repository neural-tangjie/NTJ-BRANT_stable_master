## 1. Introduction
**BRANT** stands for BRAinNetome fmri Toolkit, which is a versatile and extendable MATLAB-based toolbox developed by Brainnetome Center, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences. This tool helped me a lot in learning how to handle fMRI data during my master's degree. Once again, I would like to thank Kaibing Xu for his detailed answers to my questions during the use of the tool.  <br><br>
