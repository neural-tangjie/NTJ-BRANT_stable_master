Help information for Slice Timing:
    
slice order: the order of scans in one volume, seperated by comma or space.
TR(s): repetition time.
reference slice: normally be the number of scan in the middle of the order.(when dealing with task-fMRI, note that selecting the middle timepoint as reference will change the timing of task TR)
prefix: output prefix.
    
e.g.
    slice order: 1:2:33,2:2:32
    TR: 2
    reference slice: 33
     
end
