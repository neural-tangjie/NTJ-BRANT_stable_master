Help information for Threshold Estimation:
    
find out for each subject, the sparsity under each threshold of correlation
    
filetype: files in the filetype will be searched in input directories.
data dir: directory where all *.txt correlation matrix results are stored.
use absolute value of input matrics: as it means
    
intensity threshold: vector of thresholds for matrix intensity. e.g. correlation coefficient
out dir: output directory for saving results.
    
Buttons:
    S: Save parameters of the current panel to a *.mat file. The *.mat can be further loaded for the panel or be used in a script processing.
