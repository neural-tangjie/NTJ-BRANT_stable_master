Assume you have 5 groups of data. You can put them in one directory and use brant-preprocess, fc,reho,etc to process them at one time and store results in one directory for each step. And you want to do a between group t-test. You won't need to create 10 design matrices, you only need to prepare an excel table and match each subject's id with their group and input group-pairs in brant-statistics. brant will parse covariates (age,sex,etc) and group information for each subject and do the t-test.

2. Data information matching. Brant parses data from excel table to match the input file name, which in other case, using glm model, could be problematic. Assume the raw data is named as subj_1, subj_2,...,subj10. The folder/data will be sorted as subj_1, subj_10, subj_2,..., subj_9 in most operation systems. When selecting manually, users need to take great care of the order. Morever, the selected order can easily be forgot right after the user interface has been closed. A larger public dataset named in this way may be very difficult to match for covariates because the data is accessed by multiple users and one do not have access to modified the filename.
