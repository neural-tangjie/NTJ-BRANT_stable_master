Help information for Surface Mapping:
    
show colorbar: display colorbar
discrete color: the color of display has discrete or continuous change.
alpha: degree of opeque
max val radius(mm): radius for maximum neighbour interpolation. if the radius is greater than the size of a voxel, the program will search for maximum value within a sphere for each vertex, otherwise (leave empty or smaller than the size of a voxel) use the default 1-voxel interpolation.
display: mode of display
material: material of surface
lighting: type of light
shading: type of shader
colormap:type of color.
surface: surface file
brain vol: volume to map to the surface.
thr vol: threshold of the value which can be colour.You can input 0 or even number of incremental parameters.If nothing has been inputted, the default parameters are min and max of the value of brain.Every two parameters determine a colour region of the value of brain.
    
Buttons:
    S: Save parameters of the current panel to a *.mat file. The *.mat can be further loaded for the panel or be used in a script processing.
    L: Load parameters from *.mat for the current panel.

Tips:
1.For lighting
If you want re-lighting when a figure has been rotated by using 3D-rotate button in toolbar, you can click 3D-rotate button again to make the icon of mouse changing into a arrow and click the figure to re-lighting at angle of view.
2.For surface template
The following surface templates are from cat12/templates_surfaces:
