Data Information
    brain mask: a whole brain mask
    GSR: global signal regression
    no GSR: no global signal regression
    GSR and no GSR: do both GSR and no GSR
    multi-regression prefix: prefix for output of GLM
    filter prefix: prefix for output of filter
    reslice masks: automatically reslice unmatched masks to one of the input data
	
Trends and Tissue:
    switch on/off: turn on or off the listed covariates
    demean&detrend: add a column of 1 and a column of 1:timepoints to the GLM
    global signal mask: mask for extracting mean global signal.
    white matter mask: mask for extracting mean white matter signal.
    CSF mask: mask for extracting mean ventricle signal.
    user defined mask: mask for extracting mean user defined signal.
    
Headmotion Model:
    switch on/off: turn on or off the listed covariates
    filetype (R): normally be a rp*.txt file generated by Realign with 6 columns of headmotion parameters.
    R: six headmotion parameters generated from Realign, invols translation and rotation [pitch roll yaw].
    R': temporal derivatives of six headmotion parameters, the first volume's derivatives will be replaced by zeros.
    R^2: square of six headmotion parameters.
    R_{t-1}: previous headmotion parameters.
    scrub&regress (FD): generated a temporal mask using framwise displacement calculated from R, and do a regression without using 'bad' timepoints.
    apply temporal mask: censor 'bad' timepoints for each subject that meets the FD standard.
    
Filter:
    tr: repetition time.
    lower cutoff (Hz): lower cutoff for band pass filter.
    upper cutoff (Hz): upper cutoff for band pass filter.
